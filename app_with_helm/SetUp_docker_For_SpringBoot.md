# How to set up Docker file for a spring boot 

Here's an example Dockerfile to create an image of a Spring Boot application:

```
# Use a Java runtime as a base image
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Spring Boot application JAR file into the container at /app
COPY target/my-spring-boot-app.jar /app

# Expose port 8080 to the outside world
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the Spring Boot application when the container starts
CMD ["java", "-jar", "my-spring-boot-app.jar"]

```

### This Dockerfile does the following:

1. Starts with a base image of the Java runtime that includes the JDK and is optimized for Alpine Linux.

2. Sets the working directory of the container to /app.

3. Copies the Spring Boot application JAR file (assuming it's already been built) into the container at /app.

4. Exposes port 8080, which is the default port used by Spring Boot applications.

5. Defines the command to run the Spring Boot application, which starts the 
Java runtime and runs the JAR file using the "java -jar" command.

To use this Dockerfile, you would need to navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and the Spring Boot application JAR file and run the following command:

```
docker build -t my-spring-boot-app-image .
```

This command builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile and tags it with the name "my-spring-boot-app-image". The "." at the end of the command specifies that the Dockerfile is in the current directory. Once the image is built, you can run a container based on the image using the "docker run" command.
